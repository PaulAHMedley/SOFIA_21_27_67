# SOFIA

This is part of the improvement in transparency of the State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) biennial reporting. This project contains Quarto documents to produce reports based on the FAO FishStat capture fishery data and compiled summaries of stock assessments for the Northeast Atlantic Major Fishing Area 27, the Northwest Atlantic Area 21 and the Northeast Pacific Area 67. These have published stock assessments available through internet portals from ICES for Area 27, and the USA and Canada for Areas 21 and 67. These stock assessments have been compiled into spreadsheets which are accessed, with FishStat capture fishery data, to provide tables and graphs in the relevant SOFIA reports.

The intent is to use these reports to track changes in the stock assessments, both in which stocks are being assessed and any changes in stock status. This should lead to improved reporting and better understanding of fishery status, including what is not known.

The reports also contain some initial assessment using the SOFIA-TAF package. This uses the catch-only SRAplus model and the FishStat capture fishery data to assess the stock status for comparison with the the stock assessment summaries.  

This is a work-in-progress and there are likely to be significant changes over the next few years (to 2025). The procedures have a number of unresolved issues. To limit the file size, the output directory which includes the SRA fits has not been included in the git repo.
